An app made for when the DnD party goes into an unexpected place or strays too far from your planned notes for the session.

# Functionality
For now, this app will be able to generate the following things for DnD:
- NPC's
- Locations
- Items
The home page should be a button to generate each of the above prompts where clicking on said button will take the user to the respective button's creation page and will randomly generate the prompt clicked.

## Generation Page
Whenever the user first enters any of the pages, all the attributes will be randomly rolled to help generate a character and with the use of ChatGPT or other language model, will generate some context that can help describe the attributes together more coherently.

Each prompt will have a page that has several dropdown menus for each attribute that would define the prompt being generated. These dropdown menus will have pre coded topics I have coded in (I plan to make the user have custom topics as well if they don't like the  topics given). Each prompt should be able to be locked in case the DM likes certain attributes but wants to re-roll other attributes to their liking.

#### TL;DR
- each page should randomly roll for attributes once entering the page
- There should be a regenerate button somewhere
- each attribute should have 2 things
	- Drop down menu of preset options
	- a lock button to prevent attributes to be re-rolled

## Exporting
